# BEEED
Bibliography of Editions of Early English Drama

Data collected and curated by Brett Greatley-Hirsch. Modelling and processing to be written by Navarra Houldin and Martin Holmes.

The objective of Phase 1 of this project is to take the Endnote XML dump of BGH's dataset and convert it to valid TEI, based on the templates created by Janelle Jenstad.

In Phase 2 of the project, we will write code to generate a fully static site with integrated staticSearch from the TEI dataset. This will be hosted on the lemdo.uvic.ca platform, and will serve as the canonical target for projects referencing BEEED.
